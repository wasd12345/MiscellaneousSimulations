# MiscellaneousSimulations




summary of some of the problems.




started outline, please finish:

- random walk -> beta distribution of return times


------------------------------------------------------------

for you to do. There will be a lot of overlap between these. You can reuse structure of single sim, vs many sims, and analysis and visualizations.

- Probability of convex graph on MxN grid

- Probability of convex quadrilateral in HxW space

- other 0-1 matrix problems

- range sensor problem






I will get started on these ones:

- convolutions of correlated gaussian components

- N chaotic pendulums

- chinese rest. process / urn processes

- bayesian hyperpriors
