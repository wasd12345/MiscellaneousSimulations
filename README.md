# MiscellaneousSimulations




summary of some of the problems.




started outline, please finish:

- random walk -> beta distribution of return times


------------------------------------------------------------

for you to do. There will be a lot of overlap between these. You can reuse structure of single sim, vs many sims, and analysis and visualizations.

- Probability of convex graph on MxN grid

- Probability of convex quadrilateral in HxW space

- other 0-1 matrix problems

- range sensor problem




- Spaghetti hoops



I will get started on these ones:

- convolutions of [0-100% overlapping] correlated gaussian components

- N chaotic pendulums

- chinese rest. process / urn processes

- bayesian hyperpriors

- N series of ramdom vars -> expected value of max, when using 1,2...,K estimators; for a few common distributions -> DQ

- quadratic residue autocorrelations

- egg drop problem probabilistic version: RL solution




--------------------------------------------------------
- basic noisy channel / erasure channel sim for RL error correction
- RL queueing sim
- RL elevator dispatch
